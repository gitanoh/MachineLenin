In this story, there are TWO PROTAGONISTS:

	The Beauty: Cagent

	And the Beast: Cmaze

Cagent contains his knowledge (Cstatus), his decision for the next action (Cdecision), and can think (decides()) and act (acts())

Cmaze is the overlord, he can do what he wants, because it is not programmed yet.
	But in principle, he may kill Cagent, spawn enemies, change the walls, or even teleport Cagent whenever and wherever he wants.


Cagent can ask Cmaze for information, but for the moment he only asks when he decides(): analyse(). In this function, the maze answers (Cmazeanswer) to his demand, answer that updates his information with the new one (Cmazeanswer.learn())

Once that Cagent has at hand both information about himself and the environment, he asks himself if life is worth living: Aristoteles says that for his life to have sense, he might follow the instructions of The Great Emperor.

From the analysis of The Great Emperor instructions, from the viewpoint of the current situation, aristoteles() suggests one type of action: move towards the exit, attack the nearest enemy... Then the agent will try to discern in mind an action (imagine(action)), and analyse if it really follows Aristoteles' suggestion (decision.checkaristoteles()).
If that's the case, the decision is taken.
And the agent.acts(), by simply executing its decision.execute();

The agent may have won (victory()), or maybe not.
If he has not won yet, then Overlord The Maze resists agent's action, and reacts consequently, using his whole power against him (maze.updates())

Get ready for the next battle!
