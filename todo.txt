The only remaining thing is to program the transfer of information from
 the Cagent to the Cmaze through actions. A new class,
  analog to Cmazeanswer has to be defined, called Cagentanswer,
  but it should be identical. We could just create a Canswer class,
   but it is better just to differentiate the origin of the answer by creating
    two classes, to make things easier to us.
Of course, work on the Intelligible Realm as in the Sensible Realm should be done!
