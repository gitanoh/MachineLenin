I think it could be a good idea to think in terms of Noumena.

Space could be one (despite Kant says that space is just a product of our mind).
Therefore, we could create a Cnoumena::Cspace that contains the distribution of all walls.

In the Cstatuschild::Cposition we could then add 4 new boolean variables: wall (or not) at x+,x-,y+,y-.

This way, Cspace reveils() giving to the agent not only its x,y position, but also Cposition will contain its "walled-surround", that he will (internally) use when he decides() where to move.

It could also be good to keep track of all interesting points, not only the walls, but also the agent itself, the starting point, and the ending point (victory), so I have created a .dat.

Once we have done this, I think we would be done with the programme!!!
