Kant strikes back!

Once upon a time the lonely and empty existence of the Agent was graced by Phänomena.
The Agent discovered that Phänomena followed one another in time, and also that when he acted, the Phänomena could happen in an organised way.
In order to control the Phänomena, the agent strived to group and classify the Phänomena, and after thinking a LOT, he found the Noumena.
The Noumenon, an intelligible being that cannot be perceived, and the Phänomenon, its perceivable representation.

The Maze has plenty of Noumena(vector<Cnoumena>), but only some of them reveil as Phänomena (showsphaenomena()).
The agent has FOR NOW a limited number of Noumena in his mind, and when he analyses() reality, the maze answers (Cmazeanswer) with the representation of that limited number of Noumena(vector<Cstatuschild>reveildnoumena), and so he updates(Cstatus.update()) his noumena-structured knowledge (vector<Cstatuschild>statusvariables) about reality.
